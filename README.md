# A guide to the Paradox sailboat

*This book was written with the assistance of a custom GPT enriched with knowledge from the Yahoo mailing list.*

Paradox, first launched by Matt Layden in 1993, is a remarkable micro-cruiser that continues to surprise sailors with its abilities. Though only 13 feet 10 inches (4.2 meters) long and 48 inches (1.2 meters) wide, it has completed a wide range of voyages, including coasting around Florida, visiting the Bahamas and Cuba, sailing around parts of Hawaii, and even venturing near Australia’s Cape Leeuwin.

For ten years, the original Paradox cruised the Florida waters near Layden’s home before entering the 300-mile Everglades Challenge. There, it won first place, arriving almost a full day before the nearest competitor. Much of its success comes from a few key design features: it uses chine runners instead of a deep keel or leeboards for stability, and its simple, roller-furling lug sail can be operated from an enclosed cabin. Sailors who own a Paradox say these innovations make it surprisingly steady and comfortable to sail, even in challenging weather.

Now, even passed its 30th anniversary, Paradox continues to inspire small-boat enthusiasts around the world. This guide will look at its history, explain how it is built and sailed, and show why it remains a favorite among those who love the freedom that only a tiny cruiser can provide.

### The Wizard and the paradox

Matt Layden, known in the small boat scene as Wizard, prefers to maintain a low-key presence and has a limited footprint online. Designing megayachts for a living, his other passion lies in small sailboats, and his designs—especially the Paradox—have made a significant impact in the small boat community.

At first glance, the Paradox recalls the classic sharpie, a traditional style known for its flat-bottomed hull and pointed bow. Layden refined those elements for modern thin-water exploring. Paradox is 13 feet 10 inches long (4.2 meters), carries about 100 square feet of sail (9.3 square meters), displaces roughly 1,410 pounds (640 kilograms) in typical cruising trim, and draws about 9 inches (23 centimeters). There is no centerboard, no daggerboard, and no skeg. Instead, long chine runners along the turn of the bilge provide lateral resistance and tracking without adding draft. The bottom is flat with a pronounced rocker—a shoebox on the water—which helps the stability of the boat and makes it settle upright at low tide. Those traits suit bays, estuaries, and protected coastal waterways. Layden spent years along the U.S. East Coast in the late 1980s and early 1990s aboard small craft, working out exactly this kind of cruising.

Central to the design is a practical, experimental mindset. The cabin is fully enclosed, with wide windows and a hatch that can be opened in sunny weather and closed when the rain sets in. In the standard drawings, all working lines and the steering position are brought inside so the boat can be sailed and reefed under cover. Loads are modest and the rig is simple. The hull is built from marine plywood sealed with epoxy, with mostly straight runs and gentle curves, intended for the careful home builder using ordinary tools.

For its length, the interior is genuinely usable: there is sitting headroom, a straightforward single berth, and generous stowage. With no centerboard trunk intruding into the cabin, the space stays uncluttered and practical for solo cruising.

On the water, the shallow draft lets skippers beach the boat or anchor close to shore with little drama, and the wide, level bottom allows it to take the ground upright. The chine runners are the main talking point of the Paradox design. Together with the hull shape and large rudder, they supply the pointing ability and tracking that a keel or board would otherwise provide, especially when the boat is sailed fairly upright. Paradox is not a top-end speedster, but it makes steady, predictable miles in the kind of thin water it was built for.

### The community

Paradox did not arrive with fanfare. It spread slowly and steadily. Detailed plans made the project approachable. Dave and Mindy Bolduc, friends and frequent cruising companions of Layden, sailed several of his tiny cruisers and, for a number of years, handled inquiries and provided Paradox plan sets on request, which kept the design available. Don Elliott, an early Paradox builder, compiled and shared a widely used building guide that leans on annotated sketches and line drawings rather than photographs. His step-by-step notes removed a lot of guesswork for first-time builders. The early internet did the rest as owners and builders posted progress, compared ideas, and refined techniques across continents. The design’s reputation grew out of that community, more from people actually out cruising and reporting back than from any push by its designer.

In the 2003 Everglades Challenge, a 304-mile coastal race along Florida’s Gulf Coast, Layden’s Paradox surprised many observers by winning its class and finishing first overall. The result highlighted the boat’s strengths. By keeping the skipper dry and rested, allowing inside steering and reefing, and making reliable progress in stable offshore breezes while others worked shifting air near shore, Paradox turned endurance and efficiency into a decisive advantage.

Today it is reasonable to say between 50 and 100 Paradox boats have been started or completed worldwide. The number is modest by production standards, but each build reflects a clear idea: a shallow, tough, minimalist cruiser that rewards careful use and keeps going when the water gets thin.

## The Paradox, a microcruiser

Microcruisers are the smallest sailboats that still do the full job of cruising: you can cook, carry stores, sleep aboard, find shelter from weather, put the boat on a trailer, and keep it at home between trips. That’s the working definition many small-craft sailors use, and it captures the appeal: real voyaging in a boat that stays simple, cheap to keep, and easy to move.

### Pocket cruisers and the shift in scale
The term pocket cruiser once described the smallest of true cruising sailboats—often in the low-20-foot range—able to provide cabin space, galley, and storage in a trailerable or close-to-trailerable size. Over the years, as production boats have grown larger, “pocket” has crept upward; some new models marketed under that name are now 28 or even 30 feet long.

By contrast, the microcruiser pushes in the opposite direction. It distills the same self-sufficient cruising capability into the smallest hull that still works—often 20 feet or less, and sometimes well under that. The focus is not on shrinking a yacht, but on designing from the start for light weight, simple handling, and easy storage.

### The early roots
In the 1970s and 80s, designer Phil Bolger was exploring how far small boats could go if they were given the right mix of shelter, seaworthiness, and efficiency. His “micro” cruisers, from sharpies to plywood boxes, challenged the assumption that a cruiser needed to be big to be capable. The idea that a small, simple hull could carry a sailor comfortably for days or weeks at a time helped plant the seeds for a movement.

### The Layden years
In the 1990s, Matt Layden took the concept further. Working on the US east coast, he developed a series of compact, shoal-draft designs—Little Cruiser, Paradox, Enigma—that pushed into genuine offshore and expedition territory. Layden’s own voyages, along with the Bolducs’ Microcruising.com logs, showed these boats making repeated Bahamas passages, cruising for weeks with minimal gear, and even winning events like the 300-mile Everglades Challenge. Paradox in particular demonstrated that an enclosed, inside-sailing microcruiser could be comfortable, safe, and quick over long distances.

### Simplicity for home builders
Around the same time, Jim Michalak was designing his own take on the small cruiser—boats like Robbsboat—for amateur builders. His plans emphasized straightforward plywood construction, modest rigs, and enough enclosed space for overnighting or protected-water cruising. Many were aimed at lakes and rivers, but the philosophy—cruising without complication or high cost—resonated with a growing audience.

### The modern camp-cruiser
In the 2000s, John Welsford’s SCAMP helped bring the “camp-cruiser” into wider view: a short but high-volume hull, water ballast for stability, and a small cuddy under a hard dodger. It kept sailors in the open air but offered enough shelter for multi-day trips. SCAMP appealed to those who liked sociable sailing and cockpit living, while boats like Paradox served those who preferred to stay enclosed in poor weather.

### What ties them together
Despite their differences, these designs share common traits: compact size, usable shelter, storage for gear and food, and the ability to travel without relying on a mooring or marina. The emphasis is on boats you can keep at home, tow to new waters, and manage without a crew.

### Where Paradox sits today
Paradox stands as one of the more proven microcruisers. It’s small outside, surprisingly capable inside, and built for sailing from the comfort of a protected cabin. Its track record—from coastal cruises to race wins—helped cement the idea that microcruisers can be serious voyaging boats, not just weekend curiosities.

For many owners, that’s the point of the whole movement: useful shelter, simple systems, and low barriers to actually going. The online community—Microcruising.com, Duckworks, Small Craft Advisor, and blogs like Dirty Wet Dog—continues to share ideas, refine designs, and inspire new sailors to go small and go now.


## Key measurements and features

The Paradox has an overall length of about 13 feet 10 inches, or 4.2 meters. The waterline length is near 13 feet 5 inches, or 4.1 meters. Beam is just over 4 feet, about 1.2 meters. Draft is roughly 9 inches, or 23 centimeters, since there is no centerboard or daggerboard to lower. Displacement in cruising trim is about 1,400 pounds, or 640 kilograms.

- **Overall Length (LOA):** ~13 ft 10 in (4.2 m)
- **Length Waterline (LWL):** ~13 ft 5 in (4.1 m)
- **Beam:** ~4 ft (1.2 m)
- **Draft:** ~9 in (23 cm)
- **Displacement:** ~1400 lbs (640 kg)
- **Lead Ballast:** ~400 lbs (≈180 kg) under the sole
- **Fresh Water Ballast:** ~70 L (≈154 lbs / 70 kg) in built-in tanks
- **Sail Area:** ~100 sq ft (9.3 m²)
- **Rig Type:** Lug sail (roller-reefing on the boom)

On the trailer the Paradox sits low and square, a small, box-shaped hull with hard chines and a flat bottom that rests cleanly on the bunks. The mast is stepped off-center to port, and the rig—yard, boom, and the furled lug sail—lies along the port-side deck, lashed inboard of the rail so nothing projects beyond the trailer wheels. To starboard, the sculling oar (yuloh) is stowed blade-aft along the side, its loom secured at the quarter where it works when afloat. A large, transom-hung rudder stands aft like a barn door, pinned in sturdy gudgeons and tied off for the road. The overall impression is purposeful and compact: a blunt, boxy little cruiser whose fittings are arranged to one side for balance and easy handling, even when she’s still on the trailer.

Don Elliott once remarked that “some builders, for whatever reasons, build crooked boats with gaps, unpainted areas and poorly fitted parts, while others will build a boat like it is a piece of fine furniture, which is perfectly alright”. It’s an observation worth remembering when looking over a Paradox on her trailer. A ‘workboat finish’ will not prevent her from sailing well, and the old adage holds true—many boats are “ten-footers,” looking just fine from ten feet away and performing exactly the same as their high-gloss sisters once on the water. The Paradox’s design, with its boxy lines and unpretentious fittings, lends itself equally well to the careful cabinetmaker’s hand or the practical builder aiming simply for strength, watertightness, and seaworthiness.

### The rig

The Paradox rig is straightforward and practical. It’s a single, boomed lugsail on an unstayed mast that stands about 16 feet (4.88 m) tall. The boom, roughly 13 feet (3.96 m) long, carries the sail along the bottom edge, while the yard, about 15 feet (4.57 m) long, supports the top. There’s no standing rigging to get in the way or maintain.

Some call this a standing lug, others a balanced lug. The difference comes from the small amount of sail and spar forward of the mast. Here, the tack is set close to the mast so it works mainly like a standing lug, but the boom extends a little ahead to hold the furling drum, giving it a hint of the balanced type.

Reefing is simple. A small drum at the front end of the boom holds the furling line and lets the boom rotate. To shorten sail, you just roll it up on the boom, all from inside the cabin. With the control lines led under cover, there’s no need to go on deck when the wind picks up.

When it’s time to travel, the mast, boom, and yard will all pass through an opening in the transom and store inside the boat. The Paradox has one continuous interior space, so the spars can lie along the full length of the hull, much like sliding skis into a car with a ski pass-through.

### Chine runners

Chine runners are central to the boat’s windward ability. On Paradox they span roughly the middle third of the immersed chine. Typical width is 50–75 mm (2–3 in), and the pieces are stout, not just extensions of the bottom plywood. The concept works best with useful draft in relation to beam; a practical builders’ rule of thumb is draft around one fifth of beam, which Paradox approaches when heeled and loaded. Heeling helps by pushing the leeward runner deeper. Builders who tried full-length runners did not see clear gains. A rounded leading edge and clean fillets at the hull joint help flow. There is no skeg aft; tracking comes from the chine runners and the rudder.

We'll dive into the details of the chine runners in a later chapter, but the key takeaway is that they provide lateral resistance and tracking without the need for a deep keel or centerboard. This design choice allows Paradox to sail effectively in shallow waters while maintaining good upwind performance.

### Large rudder

The sail plan’s center of effort sits a little farther aft than on many small cruisers, so the large, balanced rudder routinely carries part of the side load. Working with the chine runners, it shares the side force, which helps reduce leeway and steadies the helm at low speed. The generous blade area keeps the rudder effective in light air. An uphaul led inside lets you adjust rudder immersion and angle underway—not essential, but very handy for sailing comfort.

### Vent trunk

The vent trunk runs from deck to sole and ties structure together around the mast partners and step. It routes lines and admits air below without much spray. In rain it behaves a bit like a small dorade. It also helps with condensation control by keeping air moving through the cabin. Some crews reduce airflow in cold weather with a simple plug or a towel.

### Control lines and sailing mechanics

Control is deliberately simple. You sail the boat with a halyard, a reefing or furling line, and a sheet. A continuous steering loop runs along both sides so you can steer from the cabin, and the rudder has an uphaul and downhaul. All sail controls come inside. Many owners add a light topping lift led through the vent trunk to hold the boom when hoisting and to manage the rolled sail.

### Cabin top

The low, hard cabin top sheds spray and keeps the watchkeeper dry. You can sit with your head out for a clear view, then drop inside and close up when rain arrives. Large windows and the low rig help visibility. Inside there isn’t a built-in berth; instead there is room for a full-length mattress for one, shelves along the sides, and space for a compact stove and anchor gear.

### Yuloh

In calms a yuloh or sculling oar moves the boat quietly and with good control. Owners report steady speeds a little under 2 knots for long stretches without undue strain. A curved blade around 9 to 10 ft long with a lanyard at the handle eases the wrist. A simple socket or notch near the starboard after corner of the cockpit works.

### Storage space

Paradox rewards tidy loading, with heavy gear stowed under the floor and along the sole to keep weight low, while lighter items ride on the side shelves. This arrangement gives a calm, steady motion: mass stays near the boat’s middle, the ends remain light, and the chine runners keep their grip. The flat bottom and runners make loading straightforward on a beach, and the boat will stand upright as the tide falls, so stores can be arranged at leisure.

Higher up, the shelves are kept shallow for light gear such as clothing, charts, and first-aid supplies, with small fiddles and light bungee or netting to keep contents in place. Because so much stowage lies low and central, trim can be fine-tuned by shifting only small amounts of weight; the boat responds quickly to such changes yet remains forgiving. Overall, everything has a home, it stays there, and the interior stays uncluttered for easy living at sea.

### Fresh water ballast

Paradox carries roughly 70 litres of internal water ballast beneath the cabin sole — about 18½ US gallons, giving a mass of 70 kg (155 lb) positioned low in the hull. This ballast adds stiffness, improves the chine runners’ grip when sailing to windward, and steadies the helm, all without increasing draft.

The ballast tanks form part of the floor’s structure, arranged as long, shallow compartments with smooth internal contours and baffles to check movement of the water. Their location low and central contributes directly to stability and comfort under sail.

In practice, most crews take on ballast at launch and keep the tanks full for windward work or in choppy conditions, then drain them before beaching, hauling out, or trailering. Empty tanks reduce overall displacement and make the boat easier to handle ashore, while full tanks enhance performance and control afloat.

## The history of the Paradox

Before Paradox, Matt Layden taught himself how to cruise by building small boats and pointing them south. He started with Terrapin, a 16-foot catboat, about 4.9 meters. In 1985 he built Swamp Thing, a skinny, decked sharpie with chine runners and a boom-furling balanced lug that was light enough to row and scull. With Swamp Thing he left Connecticut, worked down the Intracoastal Waterway, and crossed the Gulf Stream to the Bahamas. He built on tight budgets with plywood, epoxy, and hand tools, learning what was worth carrying and what was not, and how much reliability you get from simple gear that you can fix yourself.

He kept iterating. GJAC followed, another compact sharpie that refined the same shallow habits. Then in 1988 he built Little Cruiser, a 15-footer, about 4.6 meters, with water ballast, inside steering, and an unusual bow centerboard that freed up space in the cabin. He lived aboard and ranged from the Bay of Fundy to the Exumas without an engine. The Fundy run put him in Canadian waters between New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, where tidal ranges can exceed 40 feet, about 12 meters, and currents stack up in narrows. That experience reinforced his preference for simple anchoring gear, tidy decks, and a boat that could be managed alone from inside in foul weather. Those miles made the case for running control lines under cover and keeping openings small. Watertight decks, small hatches, and inside steering kept the sailor dry and off the foredeck.

One winter he stayed on Little Cruiser in Cape Cod and deliberately froze her into a salt pond, living aboard as if she were an old Arctic ship. Notes and photos from the time place him there through the freeze, the boat locked in ice and still habitable. It was a proof of concept about insulation, ventilation, and a hull that could take the load of ice without drama. It also taught him about condensation control and the value of warm air moving through a tight cabin.

### A short departure from small boats

There was a different kind of experiment with a partner. Matt met Karen, bought a used Balboa 20, about 6.1 meters, and refit it on a budget. He replaced the drop keel with a centerboard and inside ballast, then the two of them cruised the East Coast and the Bahamas together. Seeing the same miles with two people helped refine what mattered in small living spaces, especially stowage that could be reached from the bunk and a place to sit and steer without getting wet. The lesson was that weight should be low and central, lockers should open without gymnastics, and the boat should sail comfortably a notch reefed rather than pressed.

### The return to the small boat scene

By 1993 he returned to his own pattern with Paradox. He built her in Connecticut and sailed down the waterway, then out across the Banks as far as the Ragged Islands. The next season he and friends cruised in company again to the Bahamas. Paradox kept the shallow habits that worked. Chine runners instead of a centerboard. A balanced lug that rolls on the boom and reefs from inside. Steering and sail handling done from a dry chair. Low windage, a locked-down deck, and a hull that can dry out upright on a beach. The boat reads like a logbook of earlier lessons, reduced to essentials for one person. She is small but purposeful, about 13 feet 10 inches long, roughly 4.2 meters, with a sail area around 100 square feet, about 9.3 square meters, and a displacement near 1,410 pounds, about 640 kilograms. The cabin and watchkeeping arrangement reflect the birdwatcher idea, long side windows and a secure interior that let the skipper stand a watch without going on deck. Builders kept to plywood and epoxy with light glass sheathing, tough enough to slide on sand and to sit on the bottom when the tide leaves.

Layden valued quiet seamanship. He practiced sculling and used a yuloh to move his boats when the wind went slack or when he wanted control without an engine. Owners of Paradox and his other designs have kept that habit alive, often pairing oars or a yuloh with a small solar system for lights and navigation. The boats he drew reward neat trim and a touch of heel. That makes the chine runners grip and helps the rudder stay fully buried when working to windward in thin water.

If influence matters, look at the community that formed around these miles. Dave and Mindy Bolduc followed his tracks, often meeting him in Florida and crossing to the islands. They later bought Little Cruiser and sailed her to the Bahamas many times, adding their own notes to the same shallow-water playbook. Others took up chine runners and inside steering on small plywood cruisers, testing them in marshes, sounds, and the Bahamian banks. The thread that connects them is a set of choices that make sense when you expect to anchor in sand, wait out weather, and move again without fuss.

This is why the man matters as much as the boat. Matt was not chasing spectacle. He was building small, inexpensive cruisers that could slide through the ICW, wait out weather, and sleep behind a Bahamian cay in inches of water. The features that look unusual on paper came straight from those years on the East Coast and in the islands. For Paradox it meant a 13-foot 10-inch hull, about 4.2 meters, arranged for one person to sail from inside, reef quickly, anchor in very shallow water, and keep moving with a sculling oar when needed. It also meant accepting the trade, slower than a sport dinghy, but steady, dry, and simple to keep going day after day.


## Sven Yrvind and the Paradox

Sven Yrvind first met Paradox in Florida in October 1997, when he visited Matt Layden and sailed the boat for about a month. He studied its choices at close range and later returned to sail with Layden in 2003, 2006, and 2007. What struck him was how deliberately it was built for thin water. The boxy midsection, flat bottom, and low rig fit the protected sounds and shoal bays that run down the U.S. East Coast and out into the Bahamas. In that world a boat that can slide across banks, sit upright on a flat, and anchor in inches of water opens miles that deeper boats skip. Yrvind would later call the chine-runner concept “the greatest innovation for small cruising boats in the last century.”

He came away convinced the chine runner idea was the heart of the boat. Instead of a keel or a centerboard, Paradox uses narrow runners along the chines and the heeled hull side to make lateral resistance. The package works because the boat is light, shallow, and usually sailed on its feet, so the leeward side and runners act together. Yrvind has described chine runners as one of the most important small boat ideas of the twentieth century. He admired how simple structure and careful weight placement did the job without deep appendages, and how the boat could be handled from inside when weather turned poor.

### Implementing new ideas

Yrvind did not leave the insight in Florida. He built a small cruiser of his own, Yrvind.com, and gave it chine runners in clear tribute to Layden’s work. He took it to sea, crossing the Atlantic in 2011 from Ireland to Martinique. Afterward he wrote like a practical engineer. The boat had a bit too much initial stability, so it did not heel enough for the runners to bite the way he wanted, which produced some lee helm. Course keeping was excellent, and he did not need a windvane. He noted how weight placement changed the feel, and how modest sail on a tidy hull will still make good to windward if you avoid pressing too hard. Try, observe, adjust, and write down what you learned. That was his method.

He kept refining the theme with later boats and sketches. He experimented with runner geometry and argued they act less like clean foils and more like deflectors at small scales. When the boat is pressed, the runners and hull side redirect water to leeward and push the hull to windward. He compared the effect to a spoon under a tap. He also pointed to two workboat bonuses. Runners protect the bottom when the tide leaves, and they keep much of the lateral area higher on the hull, which can reduce heeling moment. None of it was mystique. It was workable physics married to parts you can build and fix.

His philosophy of size runs in parallel. Small boats, small problems. Big boats, big problems. He returns to that line in essays and updates, not as a slogan but as a summary of lived tradeoffs. Less cost, less to break, less windage, fewer systems to manage when the weather is foul. A hull that is easy to move, a rig that reefs quickly from under shelter, and controls that one person can handle after a long watch. Yrvind is often called the philosopher of the sea, a tag he has earned by treating sailing as a long experiment in self reliance and simplicity, captured in films and profiles that dwell on his reflective approach. Comfort is not the same as happiness in that view. Happiness is a boat that keeps going, that you can repair with hand tools, and that lets you choose your water.

### With four sqare meters of sail and one oar

"Many people misunderstand life. They think comfort is happiness, but unfortunately, that kind of happiness only works in the short term because, like drug abuse and instalment purchases, it burns energy intended for your future well-being. Those who enjoy effortless comfort are constantly deprived of energy. They lose strength, become lazier and fatter, have less good health and are more easily bored." -Sven Yrvind

That view shows up in what he calls his small boat manifesto. Go small to lower loads. Keep systems few and understandable. Accept modest speeds and make miles by not stopping. Favor tools you can carry and methods you can maintain alone. As part of that he favors a yuloh for quiet and economical propulsion in calms. He studied sculling traditions during time in Japan and adopted the yuloh for the way it keeps the boat moving without fuss, matches a low rig, and lets the sailor stand sheltered while making steady way.

### Finding common ground in the Paradox design

Layden and Yrvind meet on the same ground. Both choose small boats to lower loads and widen the places you can go. Both keep rigs low and controls simple so one person can reef, steer, and sleep. Both like quiet human power as the auxiliary. Yrvind favors the yuloh he studied in Japan, and Paradox was drawn to be sculled well by a sweep or yuloh, letting the sailor catch tide without the weight and noise of an engine. The shared result is range bought with simplicity.

Paradox fits that frame. It is a coastal boat at heart. That is how Layden used it. The birdwatcher cabin, the inside steering, and the balanced lug that rolls on the boom all serve the same aim. Keep the sailor dry. Keep the workload low. Move again when the tide turns. In fresh following wind Layden would even rig the lug like a square sail. By shifting the halyard attachment on the yard and leading the downhaul forward to the stem, he gave the sail a square rigger stance that Yrvind recognized from home waters. Set low and controlled with a preventer, it ran steady and would self steer as the center of effort wandered a little from side to side. It was another quiet trick to keep the pace up without fuss.

Yrvind saw the same thing up close and also in the little rituals of the workshop. In his videos he narrows fairleads to keep runs clean, grinds hardware to move it tight to the structure, and uses epoxy and glass with a bias toward lasting parts that shrug off beaching and tide. He studies where a line will chafe. He shows how to bed a fitting so it can be reused. He explains why a boat that heels modestly under a low rig tends to look after itself, and why that matters when you are alone. The habits are not fancy. They are careful and repeatable, the kind that make a small boat reliable over seasons.

Seen through Yrvind’s eyes, Paradox is not a stunt. It is a practical answer to a clear brief. Sail where the charts turn tan. Sleep dry. Keep the boat simple enough to fix. Trade some speed for access and endurance, and get it back over days because you do not stop. Chine runners are not a trick in that story. They are the structural key that lets a flat and shallow boat track and make ground. Yrvind’s boats, his Atlantic crossing, and his notes on runners and rig all speak to the same conclusion. Small and tough, sailed on its feet, a boat like Paradox can go far. That is the lesson he took from Florida, staying with Matt and Karen and watching a small, square boat make good on its promise, and it is the lesson he kept testing on open water.

To this day, by email, he still calls Paradox “a very good and interesting boat,” well suited to coastal sailing. Yrvind is now 86 and still makes small boats out of his workshop in Sweden, and when the author sends him photos of the build he always answers with a thumbs up and a few encouraging words.


## The 2003 Everglades Challenge

For readers new to the event, the Everglades Challenge is a beach-start race from Fort De Soto to Key Largo with an eight-day time limit. Boats are sail- or human-powered only—no motors—and competitors are self-supported with no prearranged outside assistance. The course runs through shallow bays and mangrove country and includes “filters” such as low bridges that require masts down and careful timing. Checkpoint locations and their order have varied by year: in 2003 checkpoint 1 was Snake Island at Venice Inlet, while in other years checkpoint 1 has been at Grande Tours in Placida. For captions and diagrams in this chapter, refer to the 2003 route sheet.

At first light on the beach at Fort De Soto, the start line looked like a catalog of speed: long kayaks with tight spray decks, quick beach cats, and dinghies with tall rigs and clean foils. Beside them sat one short, battleship-grey box of a boat with a small mast and a windowed cuddy. That was Paradox, a multi-chine plywood and epoxy boat built around bulkheads and stringers, designed and sailed by its builder, Matt Layden. The job for everyone was simple to say and hard to do: launch off the sand and cover roughly 300 statute miles (about 260 nautical miles / 480 kilometers) down Florida’s west coast, thread the Ten Thousand Islands, then cross Florida Bay to Key Largo. No engines. Self-supported. Eight days to finish. The quickest teams often arrive in two to four.

If Paradox looked out of place, that was intentional. Its features were chosen for skinny water and long days. The sail is a balanced lug of about 100 ft² (9.3 m²) that reefs by rolling around the boom, so one person can shorten sail fast from shelter. There is no keel or centerboard. Lateral resistance comes from chine runners along the bilges, backed up by a stout skeg. Steering and sail handling are done from inside a low house, dry and out of the wind. In calms, a yuloh on the stern keeps the boat moving without fuss.

### Off to a good start

As usual for the Everglades Challenge, the start was busy and a little chaotic. Southbound, the fleet split—some inside on the Intracoastal, others outside into the Gulf for cleaner air. Off Sarasota that afternoon, competitor Doug Cameron in a Sea Pearl slid alongside Paradox and chatted while reaching. When the wind sagged, he reached for oars. Layden stood up the yuloh and eased ahead. By the first checkpoint at Snake Island (Venice Inlet), Layden’s lead was already measured in hours.

Two early moments framed the week. Behind Passage Key, a kayaker capsized; Layden towed him to Anna Maria Island, then carried on. That evening, when the breeze faded, many boats stopped. Paradox kept moving. The pairing—steady forward motion and a dry, warm place to rest—defined what came next.

The Challenge forces choices quickly: inside or outside, push on or anchor, sleep now or later. That year brought a mixed bag—stretches of headwind over 20 knots, thunderstorms near Placida, and long glassy holes that punished both paddlers and sailors. Paradox’s edge was endurance engineering rather than peak speed. The boat could be closed up and sailed from inside when spray turned cold and the wind headed the fleet. It could anchor in inches and let the skipper sleep out of the bugs without landing. When the wind died, the yuloh meant progress instead of drift. Several racers later noted that while they waited on tide or weather, Paradox kept going.

A checkpoint at Grande Tours in Placida required a low-bridge, masts-down shuffle that favors shallow, simple rigs. With no deep appendages to mind and little draft to worry about, Paradox was at home there. From Placida toward Chokoloskee, the field thinned as the water got shallower, the channels twistier, and the decisions tighter.

Plenty of boats in that fleet were faster in a snapshot. A Sea Pearl can walk away given the right angle. Beach cats fly when wind and wave line up. But a three-hundred-mile, self-supported course is not a snapshot. Speed here is the average of many small calls: tack now or wait, short-tack inside or take the outside line, reef early and nap or press and pay later. On that calculus, Paradox’s always-moving profile stacked the deck. Accounts from the race note Layden sometimes slipped offshore to find steadier wind while others fought patchy land breeze. He could rest without landing. He was not trapped in the stop-start rhythm that open boats and paddle craft face.

### First in its class

Layden sailed Paradox onto the Key Largo beach in 3 days, 10 hours, 51 minutes—first overall and first in Class 4 (monohull sailboats). The next finisher, Team Melaleuca, arrived about 16 hours later at 4 days, 2 hours, 57 minutes. For an event often topped by longer, lighter boats, that gap told its own story. In the small-boat world it read as proof that a microcruiser with chine runners and a short rig could not only survive this course, but control it.

The 2003 win did more than add a trophy. It moved opinions. Paradox looks like a contradiction—short, heavy, boxy. On paper it should not hang with long waterlines and tall rigs. On the water, over days, its systems thinking paid off: sail from inside, reef fast, anchor almost anywhere, scull in calms. That turned into miles banked while others burned energy or lost ground. Comfort was not indulgence. In an expedition race, warm and dry is fast.

The ripples came quickly. Racers reconsidered boats and strategies. In later years, record chases came from different directions—paddle-sail hybrids that exploit calms and ultralight multihulls that exploit breeze. Layden later pushed the same ideas further in Enigma, a smaller and lighter follow-on developed from Paradox principles. But 2003 belongs to Paradox—the small boat that showed what “fast enough” looks like when you do not stop.


## The history of Matt Layden designs

Before the Paradox, three notable designs — "Terrapin," "Swamp Thing," and "Little Cruiser" — were instrumental in shaping Matt Laydens approach to design. Each of these vessels bore distinct features and imparted valuable insights, directly influencing the development of the Paradox.

Terrapin, one of Layden's earliest designs, introduced foundational concepts and revealed critical areas for improvement, particularly in terms of stability and leeway control. Following Terrapin, Swamp Thing marked a significant shift with its use of chine runners instead of traditional leeboards, enhancing upwind performance in shallow waters. Lastly, Little Cruiser, with its complex design including a centerboard and a focus on interior space and safety, further evolved Layden's approach. These boats collectively laid the groundwork for the advanced design and functionality embodied in the Paradox sailboat.

### Terrapin

Terrapin was Matt Layden’s first home-built microcruiser from the mid-1980s. She measured about 4.20 m (13 ft 9 in) in length, 1.60 m (5 ft 3 in) in beam, drew roughly 0.20 m (7.9 in), and displaced about 700 kg (≈1,540 lb). She carried a fully-battened mainsail and toed-in leeboards beside a small cabin, and was reported as quick to windward with adequate accommodation.

In use—on a run to Florida and back to Connecticut—Layden found the leeboards cumbersome and noisy, and prone to catching debris. A severe knockdown off the Maine coast also exposed the limits of a shoal-draft, relatively beamy hull’s self-righting; in that incident the large-diameter hollow mast’s buoyancy helped prevent a full inversion and the boat was later righted. These experiences pushed him to rethink how to resist leeway and recover from heavy weather.

These insights gained from sailing Terrapin were instrumental in Layden's evolving design philosophy, particularly influencing his decision to move away from leeboards in favor of chine runners in his later designs, such as Swamp Thing​​​​.

The Terrapin served as a foundational project for Layden, influencing his future creations. Its design elements, both successful and challenging, played a significant role in the evolution of his next designs, including the transition to chine runners as seen in his next microcruising sailboat.

### Swamp Thing

Swamp Thing, constructed in 1985, was a pivotal design in Layden's journey. It was his first micro cruiser to utilize chine runners, a significant departure from the traditional leeboards used in his earlier design, Terrapin. These chine runners or external chine logs, which replaced the cumbersome leeboards, were simpler and more efficient, significantly improving the boat's upwind performance in shallow waters.

Swamp Thing was relatively small, with a length of 13 feet and 2 inches or 4 meters and a beam of 3 feet 8 inches or 1.1 meters. Despite its size, it proved capable of long voyages, as Layden sailed it down the East Coast of the United States and out to the Bahamas. This journey was a testament to the boat's seaworthiness and Layden's skill as a sailor. The boat's design featured a simple lug sail that could be manually rolled or furled around the boom, adding to its practicality.

### Little Cruiser

Little Cruiser, built in 1988, marked another evolution in Layden's design philosophy. While similar in length to Swamp Thing, it represented a more complex design. It featured a centerboard and a battened lug sail with slab reefing, all lines leading down through the centerboard trunk into the cabin. The mast, stepped on deck, could be easily folded down with an unusual "A" frame tabernacle.

The boat's design focused on creating ample interior space and ensuring the comfort and safety of its occupant in all weather conditions. Little Cruiser was well-insulated with foam, adding dryness and positive buoyancy, and was equipped with four large built-in water ballast tanks to facilitate long-range cruising.

Little Cruiser's length overall (LOA) is 15 feet 2 inches (4.62 meters)​.

Matt Layden spent a winter on Little Cruiser in Cape Cod frozen into the ice. Despite the freezing conditions, the boat's foam insulation kept the interior dry, allowing him to stay warm with just his stove. Little Cruiser's spacious cabin and water ballast tanks made it suitable for long trips. Matt lived on it for four years, traveling from the Bay of Funday to the Bahamas. His experience showed the boat's capability in various weather conditions.

Dave and Mindy Bolduc, who acquired Little Cruiser in 1992, undertook numerous journeys in her, including several trips to the Bahamas. They emphasized Little Cruiser's robust construction, including a 1-inch thick plywood bottom and substantial framing, which proved invaluable during their extensive cruising, including a trip where they encountered a reef in the Bahamas. The boat's design allowed for easy beaching for repairs, highlighting its practicality for long-distance cruising.

### Paradox

The development of the Paradox was influenced by Swamp Thing, Little Cruiser, and Terapin. Swamp Thing introduced chine runners and a simplified sailing rig, elements that Layden adopted in the Paradox. Similarly, Little Cruiser contributed ideas regarding interior space, comfort and rigging systems. Terapin's design elements also played a part, further shaping Layden's approach. Ultimately, Layden opted for chine runners in the Paradox, prioritizing performance and simplicity, and deeming the centerboard's advantages as not substantial enough to justify its complexity.

### Enigma

Enigma, built in 2005, was approximately 12 feet or 3.6 meters in length. This boat was notably lighter than its predecessors, employing a stitch and glue construction method and being covered with fiberglass. A notable departure from the Paradox, Enigma lacked longitudinal stringers and featured a V-shaped forward portion of the hull, as opposed to the flat bottom of the Paradox. Above the cabin, Enigma had a canvas dodger rather than the plywood cabin top seen in the Paradox. Matt Layden showcased the capabilities of Enigma by participating in the Florida Ultimate Challenge, where he achieved a commendable 3rd place overall​​.

Building on the foundation laid by Enigma, Matt designed the Enigma 460 in 2007. This version was three feet longer than the original Enigma and featured a plywood cabin top, aligning more closely with the design of the Paradox. George Van Sickle undertook the construction of the Enigma 460's prototype and was involved in conducting sea trials with this version as of summer 2010. The Enigma 460, described as a lighter, stitch and glue construction coastal cruiser, was approximately the same size as the Paradox but offered a faster and easier build process. It embodied characteristics similar to the Paradox, such as chine runners, a flat bottom with rocker, and box sides, but set itself apart as a light displacement vessel compared to the heavy displacement Paradox. George Van Sickle's work on the Enigma 460, including the addition of a 'hard top' cabin, further contributed to the evolution of Layden's boat designs.

However, the plans for both the original Enigma and the Enigma 460 never found their way to the public. Despite this, several Enigma 360 boats have been built using pictures and forum posts available on the internet. Notable among these are Dave Fahy's "Goliath," completed in 2021, and André-François Bourbeau's boat "Question," launched in the same year. Both of these builds are well-documented on YouTube and Facebook, providing valuable insights into their construction process.

### Elusion

Elusion is one of Matt Layden's latest design, a progression from his Enigma model, but notably lighter. This micro-cruiser has a length of 9 feet or 2.7 meters and a beam of 38 inches ort 96 centimeters. Its sail area is substantial for its size, approximately 100 square feet or 9.3 square meters. One of the defining features of Elusion is its weight, at around 120 pounds or roughly 54 kilograms, making it car-toppable and convenient for transportation. Instead of the usual sculling oar, the Elusion uses a stand-up paddle for auxiliary propulsion. With a draft of approximately 6 inches or just ovver 15 centimeters, and a displacement of around 360 pounds or 160 kilograms, the Elusion is designed for ease of handling and functionality in a small sailing vessel.

In 2010, Layden successfully competed in the 1200-mile Watertribe Ultimate Challenge race in Florida, securing first place in his class with the Elusion.

## Chine Runners

Often described as a Scheel keel withouth the keel, the Paradox sailboat’s chine runners offer a distinctive take on small-boat design. While they may appear modest, these horizontal fins enable the boat to handle a wide range of wind and water conditions with noteworthy agility and stability. Unlike traditional appendages such as keels or centerboards, chine runners marry simplicity with usefulness—particularly evident when sailing to windward.

Conceived by designer Matt Layden, chine runners consist of thin, horizontal, wing-like structures that extend from the chine—the line where the hull sides meet the bottom. On Paradox they typically span about the middle third of the bottom—roughly one-third of the boat’s length—providing effective lateral area without resorting to a centerboard or leeboard. This is beneficial in shallow waters where deep foils can be impractical, and it shows another workable route to small-boat sailing.

Compared to older designs that rely on centerboards or hefty keels, chine-runner hulls keep the underwater profile streamlined. They reduce moving parts and help maintain a shallower draft, opening up waterways that might be off-limits to deeper boats. Instead of fitting a swinging or retractable foil beneath the hull, builders incorporate the runners directly into the hull shape. Doing so preserves interior space and simplifies upkeep, since there are no large pivot points or board casings to maintain. (Paradox’s published draft is about 230 mm/9 in.)

The central purpose of chine runners is to combat leeway, the sideways drift caused by the wind’s push on the sails. Because the runners sit along the hull’s underwater edge, they interact with the flow when the boat is moving with a touch of heel. The leeward hull side and runner work together to deflect water and create sideforce to stay on course; a large, well-balanced rudder shares some of the load. Placing the runners along the middle stretch of the chine concentrates area where it is most effective without the drag and complexity of deep foils.

Along with this functional advantage, chine runners make day-to-day sailing straightforward. There’s no board to crank up or down or a leeboard to manage against the hull. Maintenance is simpler, and the result suits sailors who value easy handling in coastal areas, tidal flats, and other shallow regions.

Though not every boat uses chine runners, they demonstrate how relatively small, thoughtfully placed structures can substitute for more conventional methods of generating lateral resistance. Layden used them on boats such as Swamp Thing and Paradox, while other designs like Little Cruiser pursued different solutions. The common thread is shallow draft cruising with practical performance.

### Phil Bolger’s influence

Matt Layden’s application of chine runners owes a clear debt to the work of Phil Bolger, a prolific and often unconventional boat designer. A key example is Bolger’s steel sharpie Lion’s Paw, whose 10 mm bottom sheet extended about 50 mm (≈2 in) beyond the hull sides. Bolger used this projecting edge to simplify upright construction for amateur builders and to protect the thinner sides during groundings. He also observed that, on a large hull, the lip should not noticeably increase resistance because it restricts cross-flow between side and bottom. These edges were not intended to improve tacking ability, and Lion’s Paw used leeboards.

Layden saw a further possibility. With minor changes, that edge could do more than protect the hull and ease construction—it could help a flat-bottomed sailboat go to windward. To explore this, he built two same-size models: one with round bilges, another with a flat bottom and what he called “chinerunners.” Towed side by side in slow current, they showed little difference. In faster flow or when heeled about thirty degrees, the chinerunner model moved ahead. Those simple trials encouraged Layden to try the concept full-scale.

An equally notable outcome in Paradox is the very low level of forward “hull slap.” Flat-bottomed hulls often pound when a bow rides high over short chop. By contrast, Paradox trims with the bow nearly down and rocker rising aft; in that attitude owners report quiet nights and little slap underway. Keeping weight and water ballast placed to sit near the painted waterline helps maintain this behavior.

### Hydrodynamics and aerodynamics

In some respects, the Paradox sailboat achieves what many once considered unlikely. The “bumblebee” line—used in praise of chine-runner boats—does appear in discussions around Paradox; treat it as a colorful metaphor, not a physics lesson. What matters is that the hull and runners, sailed with a touch of heel, act together as a shallow side-force system that lets the boat point higher than its profile might suggest.

To make sense of Paradox’s upwind efficiency, Layden and others have looked beyond simple wing analogies to other flow phenomena. One concept is the “slender bodies” picture highlighted by C. A. Marchaj when explaining the strong performance of the Polynesian crab-claw sail. The lesson is that unconventional shapes can produce useful lift and control under the right conditions—a helpful analogy rather than a claim that the mechanisms are identical.

A common comparison is to aerodynamic “fences” that limit spanwise flow on wings. Chine runners serve a related purpose in water by organizing the flow along the hull side and helping maintain pressure differences. For attribution clarity: Francis Rogallo popularized flexible “parawings” that informed hang-gliding; that thread is separate from NASA’s lifting-body research. The useful takeaway is simply that body shape can contribute to lift in a fluid, which is the role the hull-plus-runners play here.

### Lateral resistance

In a sailboat, any deviation from your intended course downwind is called leeway. Designs traditionally counter it with deep, submerged fins—keels, centerboards, or daggerboards. The Paradox’s chine runners allow the hull itself to serve this role: as the boat heels and slides slightly, the leeward side and runner generate sideforce to resist drift. Think flow deflection working together with pressure difference, rather than a pure high-aspect hydrofoil story. A large rudder carries part of the side load by design, which is why Paradox can balance well without a board.

This layout brings practical advantages. A traditional keel or daggerboard complicates launching in shallow water and increases draft—meaning you need more water beneath the boat. By contrast, chine runners barely extend below the main hull. On a Paradox, you can comfortably beach, explore tidal flats, or sail in waters where deeper-keel yachts must steer clear, while keeping the cabin free of a centerboard case.

While chine runners take center stage in the Paradox design, they are one example of how ideas cross over between fields. Through observation, simple model tests, and careful reading—some of it outside mainstream yacht thinking—Layden transferred a construction edge into a working upwind tool. The result is a boat that keeps draft shallow, points respectably, and remains easy to build and maintain.

For modern small-craft designers and home builders, the lesson is modest but powerful: use the hull you already have, place small structures where the flow matters, and keep the mechanism simple. Paradox’s story shows that you don’t need deep appendages to cruise well in skinny water—you need an honest balance of hull shape, chine runners, and a well-sized rudder, sailed with a touch of heel.

### Chine runners effect on draft

The distance between a boat’s waterline and its deepest point is known as draft, and it greatly affects where a sailboat can venture. Deep keels or heavy boards often provide strong lateral resistance for traditional sailboats, but they also limit access to shallow or coastal waters and complicate beaching or launching. Chine runners, in contrast, give boats like the Paradox similar resistance with a much shallower draft. This means easier navigation in thin water, as well as simpler beaching and exploration of tidal flats—activities that deeper keels simply rule out.

Heeling adds to the chine runners’ effectiveness. Rather than losing bite when a boat tips, the runner on the lower side dips more deeply, creating extra lift and helping the boat stay on course against the wind. A rule of thumb is to maintain a draft roughly one-fifth the vessel’s beam so the runner remains submerged even when the hull is tilted. At moderate heel angles of about 20 to 30 degrees, the Paradox can keep its sideways drift under control, an important quality for upwind work.

This approach allows for a boat with a minimal keel profile that still performs well to windward. You can cruise in shallower waters, land directly on a beach, and then head back out under sail. If the breeze picks up, the chine runners work efficiently with the angled hull, letting you sail closer to the wind without a large, cumbersome keel hanging below.

### Internet mythology

In an interview with Small Craft Advisor magazine, Matt Layden spoke candidly about what he calls the “mythology” surrounding chine runners. Over the years, some internet discussions have suggested that these horizontal strakes alone account for the Paradox’s surprising sailing ability, and that they replace the need for centerboards, daggerboards, or other foils. Layden clarified this misunderstanding: chine runners are only one feature of a carefully balanced arrangement. Their function depends on hull form, rig placement, and weight distribution; on their own, they cannot do the job of a traditional fin or centerboard.

He explained that the lifting-body hull, in particular, is key. Its geometry allows for effective lateral resistance even without a large foil underwater, but chine runners help refine that process. They form part of an integrated design strategy rather than a stand-alone solution. This means that while the hull could still work without them, the performance boost gained from having the runners is significant. They effectively guide water flow around the lower part of the hull, especially when the boat is heeled, supporting better windward ability.

Although people online sometimes oversimplify or exaggerate the runners’ role, it’s safe to say they have changed the conversation about how small boats can be built for shallow-water or coastal cruising. Shallow-draft designs like the Paradox show that a cleverly shaped hull combined with chine runners can achieve results many sailors once thought required deep fins or centerboards. A modest draft, easier launching, and access to shoal areas are among the benefits. Yet, in Layden’s view, the internet mythology fails to capture the interplay of elements—hull shape, sail plan, chine runners, and weight placement—all working together. Without this larger perspective, it’s easy to assume that the runners alone perform a task that, in reality, rests on the entire concept.

## Mast, rig and sail

The lug sail has a loyal following in backyard shops and small sheds because it does serious work with a short parts list. You can sew it at home, hoist it without winches, and reef it without gymnastics. That practical streak is exactly what Paradox carries forward. The only controversy is a friendly one: what, precisely, to call Paradox’s lug. Part of the sail is set ahead of the mast, which makes many people say “balanced lug.” Others point to how the tack and yard are handled and argue it’s a standing-lug variant. The archives show both positions in black and white, which is a good reminder that labels matter less than how the thing works.

On this boat the geometry is simple and intentional. A single lug of about 100 sq ft (9.3 m²) rolls on its boom; the tack sits on deck just forward of the mast; a small portion of the sail lives ahead of the spar, while the boom itself is free—there’s no boom jaw or gooseneck clamped to the mast. The roller drum is built into the boom’s nose and a reefing/furling line turns the boom. You hoist on the halyard, reduce by easing halyard and hauling the reefing line, and you do it all from inside.

The mast is straightforward and unstayed. It steps low and passes through partners inside the vent trunk, which also drains green water from the foredeck so the working area stays tidy. The plans specifically show drilling the deck for the leads and lining those holes with soft copper tube. You flare the top lip and coat it with epoxy so the halyard and reefing line run cleanly and the deck edge doesn’t chafe. Many boats make the starboard vent-trunk panel removable to mount the halyard turning block and keep access; builders report no leakage even without a gasket, and note that the drain under the mast step sits above the waterline.

The mast itself is close-grain Douglas-fir, with a flat aft face, glass reinforcement at the head, and a small masthead sheave. It’s sealed in epoxy and painted rather than varnished so it tolerates handling, scraping, and sun; there’s also room to lay a wire for a light and a lightning strap before the final side goes on. None of it is fancy, and that’s the point.

### Running rig

At the tack, a compact assembly does the quiet heavy lifting. A curved rod at the boom’s nose mates to a vertical spacer pipe that passes through a low-profile through-deck fitting; between them is an axle so the boom can move as it rolls and, when fully furled, swing outboard to clear the hatch and lie on the side deck. The down-lead through the spacer pipe is an 8 mm (5⁄16 in) line to a cleat inside the vent trunk. This fitting also fairleads the reefing line and checks boom rise; it is not a deck-mounted drum support—the drum lives in the boom’s nose.

All working lines come into the cabin. The halyard passes through a through-deck fitting on the foredeck, turns 90° on a foot block mounted inside the vent trunk, and is secured in a cam cleat on the face of the vent box, facing the pilot. The reefing/furling line follows the same logic: led from the drum at the boom’s nose through the tack assembly, in through a through-deck fitting, around a short foot block in the trunk, and into its own cam cleat on the vent-box face. If a topping lift is fitted, route it the same way so every control lands where you can reach it from your seat.

The boom is purposely tapered so the roll builds evenly. Think rectangles with soft corners: about 50 × 38 mm (1.97 × 1.50 in) at the clew and 35 × 38 mm (1.38 × 1.50 in) at the tack—a circumference difference of roughly 30 mm (1.2 in). That bias encourages the cloth to “walk” onto the roll without creasing or letting the clew droop as diameter grows. As the sail reefs it will creep a touch forward on the boom; you simply allow for that in your starting position so the final roll stays clear of the drum.

A topping lift is common and treated as a light helper. Many rigs use a two-leg “Y” that meets above the boom, runs over the masthead, and leads down with the other lines; others keep a short half-lift at the forward end to keep the boom off the water in sloppy conditions. It supports the boom while you start the hoist or take in reefs, then goes slack so it doesn’t touch the rolling sail. At the aft end, a simple three-hole strap does the work: mainsheet in the lower eye, the strap bolted through the middle, and the topping-lift tail or a lashing in the top eye. Make that strap stout; a flimsy one will bend into the roll and foul it.

A parrel on the yard is optional. The halyard connection at the masthead already behaves like a universal and, together with the spacer-pipe down-lead at the deck, keeps the geometry honest. Boats that do fit a light parrel keep it just taut enough to guide without adding friction.

### Handling the sails on the Paradox

Handling follows one rhythm and rewards small, even motions. To hoist and unroll, head up, ease the reefing line a touch so the boom starts to rotate, and take the halyard in steady pulls while keeping a little tension on the reefing line so the remaining wraps stay tight. To reef, reverse in short bites: ease a bit of halyard, take a bit of reefing line—always keeping some load on the “other” line. Foot-on-the-idle-line is a handy trick when you need both hands. When you’re done, swing the furled boom outboard on its axle to open the fore hatch, or back inboard to sail. Luff tension after hoisting is maintained by the reefing line load; the tack line through the spacer pipe mostly sets boom height and is “make fast and forget.”

If you care about taxonomy, the debate will probably continue: part of the sail lies forward of the mast like a balanced lug, the boom itself is free, and the tack sits just ahead of the spar; depending on which feature you weight most, you’ll land on “balanced lug” or “standing-lug variant.” On the water, the label doesn’t change the behavior. What matters is the compact system: a close-grain Douglas-fir mast stepped inside a vent trunk; copper-lined deck leads into the cabin; a tapered boom with its drum tucked into the nose; a common, lightly-set topping lift for handling; and an optional parrel you can happily omit. The result is a rig you work from a sheltered seat that hoists, reefs, and stows with a minimum of drama—which is exactly what Paradox set out to achieve.

## Rudder

On Paradox the rudder is deliberately large for such a small cruiser and it does more than aim the bow. It carries a meaningful share of the lateral (side) load that keeps the boat from sliding to leeward, working as part of an integrated system with the chine runners and the lifting-body hull. In practice the leeway-resisting force is shared between hull, runners, and rudder—often in something like a 40–60 split either way—so the center of lateral resistance sits well aft, and the whole rig is set aft to match.

The blade itself presents as about 1 in (25–26 mm) thick in most Paradox builds, the result of two 12 mm plywood skins sheathed in fiberglass. That thickness supports a true foil section while staying tough enough for beach cruising. The section used on Paradox carries a small flat at the trailing edge rather than a knife point—counterintuitive on paper, but proven to run with less drag at the speeds Paradox lives in and far more durable in use.

Paradox’s chine runners act as “fences,” helping the lifting-body hull develop sideforce without a deep centerboard. The rudder completes that lateral plane and adds authority for course-keeping, which is why the boat can make honest progress to windward in skinny water. The runners aren’t magic on their own; they’re part of the same package that includes the big, efficient rudder.

The assembly is in two pieces. A fixed rudder stock bolts to the transom and includes a small boarding step molded into its lower aft face. It sits close to the waterline—handy after a swim or a grounding shuffle—and owners often mention its usefulness along with its limits, especially if an outboard occupies the port quarter.

Hinged to the stock is a kick-up blade. In shoal water it pivots upward rather than prying on the transom, then drops back to its working depth. The blade is shaped as a modest, forgiving foil with that characteristic square-ish tail; many Paradox sailors favor small, practical reinforcements at the leading edge in abrasive waters, a nod to the “beachable” brief of the design.

Depth control stays true to Paradox’s inside-the-boat philosophy: an in-cockpit uphaul lifts the blade for shallows or beaching, and many boats include a light down-assist for convenience. Under normal way the forward edge stands close to vertical when the blade is down, and the helm feels settled and positive.

Steering is by a tiller that passes through the transom via a baffle-vent opening. That opening is part of the boat’s breathing system and also sheds the occasional splash back out; owners sometimes use loose, flexible deflectors in heavy weather, but the point remains that ventilation at the stern is by design.

Helm authority is generous but measured. The rudder works best within about 15° of angle to either side; past that the foil can stall and feel mushy. Sailed within that envelope, Paradox tracks calmly and answers the helm with the quiet confidence that characterizes the design.

In short, the Paradox rudder is not an afterthought. It is a deep, efficient partner to the hull and runners, sized to carry real sideforce, built stout enough for beach cruising, and arranged so the skipper can manage depth and steering from inside the little cabin—hallmarks of the boat’s practical, coast-cruising intent.

## Ballast

The Paradox may not immediately catch the eye when seen on a trailer due to its pronounced rocker and flat bottom. However, this initial impression is deceptive. When the Paradox is in its element, sitting low on its lines in the water, it reveals a different persona. It takes a relatively large amount of ballast to bring the Paradox down to its waterline, an essential aspect of its design. This need arises primarily due to the boat's underwater structure, particularly the chine runners. These chine runners are designed in such a way that the boat's draft needs to be at least one-fifth of its beam. To achieve this, approximately 400 pounds or 180 kilograms of lead ballast is placed under the floor, which is crucial for lowering the boat's center of gravity and enhancing stability, especially in choppy sea conditions.

On the Paradox, the highest part of the rocker is located just behind the center of the boat. This spot is right where the skipper sits and close to where most of the ballast is, just a bit ahead. This setup helps the chine runners work better. On the other hand, boats like Jim Michalak's Robbsboat have an even rocker with the highest point more towards the front. Here, the chine runners might be a bit too far forward, which can slightly change how the boat sails. This shows why it's important to get the placement of the rocker and chine runners right.

Despite its heavy ballast, the Paradox sailboat is designed to stay afloat, thanks to several practical design features. Air pockets are included in various parts of the boat, such as the forepeak, which is accessible by a small hole, to help it float. Foam plates are installed between the deck beams, which also assist in flotation and help reduce condensation under the deck. Additionally, the boat uses water ballast, which is neutral in buoyancy, to maintain stability without affecting its buoyancy.

The Paradox's design allows for the use of additional gear, such as anchors, to serve as supplementary ballast. This proves beneficial for those looking to minimize the amount of lead and maximize space aboard. By strategically placing gear like anchors in the boat, builders can achieve the necessary ballast weight while also having practical equipment on board.

The Paradox also incorporates built-in water tanks as part of its ballasting system. These tanks serve a dual purpose: they provide supplemental ballast when filled, further lowering the boat's center of gravity and improving stability, and they also offer a fresh water supply for extended voyages. Specifically, the water tanks are situated under the floors near the foot of the mast. This location ensures they contribute effectively to the boat's ballasting while being accessible for maintenance and use. The system consists of two chambers, with a total capacity of 18 gallons or approximately 70 liters. While originally designed for fresh water storage, as exemplified in the construction of the Paradox, some builders have adapted these tanks to draw water from the sea.

### Self righting up to 165 degrees

The Paradox, when properly loaded and ballasted, can right itself completely under normal circumstances, a feature that is essential for safety at sea, especially in challenging conditions. The design takes into account the dynamics of heeling and capsizing. Notably, the stability charts for the Paradox indicate a self-righting arm up to 165 degrees, and it is confirmed through practical demonstrations that a correctly ballasted Paradox will definitely self-right from a 90-degree heel. Capsize tests on the Paradox, documented in various YouTube videos, demonstrate the vessel's exceptional stability. Efforts to capsize the boat by standing on its side and pulling the mast have proven nearly futile. In another test, the Paradox is tilted to a near 90-degree angle while the pilot remains aboard and leaning to the side, with two additional individuals applying downward force on the mast. Notably, upon release, the boat exhibits an impressive ability to return to its upright position, showcasing a significant dampening effect that almost immediately stabilizes the boat.

Comparatively, many dory and sharpie designs are not inherently self-righting or self-rescuing. Matt Layden, in designing the Paradox, began with a sharpie shape but modified it to behave more like a kayak. This means the Paradox is self-righting if someone is safely inside, and self-rescuing in that it can right itself if it completely capsizes, or "turns turtle", similar to a kayak rolling over.

In terms of trailering, the water ballast system presents a significant advantage. When the tanks are emptied, the overall weight of the boat is reduced, making it easier to transport on a trailer. This feature is especially beneficial for sailors who frequently transport their boats overland. The reduction in trailer weight not only makes transportation easier but also more fuel-efficient, which is an important consideration for many boat owners.

## Vent Trunk

At its core, the vent trunk is a vertical box structure that spans from the deck to the floor of the sailboat. On the front, inside the boat, it includes an opening that serves for ventilation, accommodating ropes and a series of cleats. At the top, on the deck, it features two distinct openings: one for inserting the mast and another for ventilation. Its primary purpose is to hold the mast step and mast partners, providing crucial support for the mast.

Ventilation is a critical aspect of the vent trunk's functionality. It is equipped with an opening approximately 6 inches (150mm) in size, allowing for efficient air circulation within the cabin. This feature is vital for maintaining a fresh and comfortable atmosphere inside the boat, particularly important in smaller spaces like those found in the Paradox. By ensuring consistent airflow, the vent trunk helps in reducing dampness and preventing the accumulation of condensation, which is essential for both the comfort of the occupants and the preservation of the boat's interior.

The vent trunk also cleverly incorporates a drainage system that extends through the hull, discharging any water that enters onto the deck directly out to sea. This ingenious design, positioned above the waterline, is particularly beneficial in adverse weather conditions, where water ingress can pose a significant challenge. The interior of the vent trunk is glassed, making it watertight.

Beyond its ventilation and drainage capabilities, the vent trunk is smartly utilized for organizing the boat's lines. Most of the lines, including the main halyard, topping lift, and roller furler, are led back to the cockpit through this central point. This arrangement is not only a testament to the efficient use of space but also significantly enhances the sailboat's ease of handling. For a vessel often managed by a solo sailor, such convenience in line handling is invaluable, especially under challenging sailing conditions. Cleats mounted on the front of the vent trunk further facilitate the secure and convenient operation of these lines.

## The people who keep Paradox afloat

The Paradox sailboat is a shared project as much as a hull. Its story is told by the people who passed around drawings, argued the merits of fittings, posted their triumphs and mistakes, and kept records so the next builder didn’t have to start from nothing.

One of the clearest voices belonged to Don Elliott. He gathered what he learned into Paradox—A Detailed Building Guide, first published in 1995 and re-issued in 2004. The front matter shows Elliott’s intent: minimal prose, heavy illustration, and clear ordering information for plans handled by David Bolduc. The goal was straightforward help from one builder to another.

Elliott’s material also circulated as a 16-part “Building Paradox” series in Messing About in Boats, later bundled and distributed as PDFs or on CD by his widow, Wanda. Group posts from 2009 describe the booklet’s contents—over 100 illustrations and an enlarged ballast section—and how Wanda fulfilled orders quickly, often by email and PayPal. Years later, she was still fielding requests, and the family discussed adding a download site to make access easier.

The list was where news—good and bad—moved fastest. On May 5, 2017, members relayed that Don’s own Paradox was for sale: sound hull, in need of fresh paint, $2,800 including trailer and cruising gear, with Wanda’s contact. It reads like a notice pinned to a club board, passed along by people who knew both the boat and the builder.

Shared references shaped how people pictured the boat. Glen Maxwell’s Zoe became a touchstone; posters said they kept photos of Zoe alongside their plans, and called the boat “inspirational” for their own builds. When Zoe was lost in a transport-trailer fire in 2011, the reaction showed how one well-finished Paradox could steer the taste and technique of dozens more. Maxwell’s earlier “sea trials” article in Duckworks is still a frequently cited window into how the boat works underway. 

### The UK scene

Across the Atlantic, the UK contingent added its own landmarks. Alastair Law’s Little Jim site gave clean, chronological photo pages and an open-door tone—“come and see it in the flesh”—signed from Yeovil, England. Two decades on, Law was still talking Paradox to wider audiences, including a 2020 club talk about building and sailing his 14-foot cruiser. The site now points newcomers to the current discussion venues. 

Another detailed UK record is Johanna. Pete Martin’s blog and steady forum posts covered the last push to launch and the first sails. The “Johanna launched” thread shows the community at work—photos added to the group album, congratulations, then immediate questions about trailer geometry and launch angles. It’s a snapshot of the forum as classroom, gallery, and help desk at once.

What people talked about reveals the culture. It’s practical and unvarnished: fastener choices cross-checked against the plan notes; debates about rigs and reefing; recurring “does this really need to be by-the-book?” questions that usually land on “follow the drawings unless you have a good reason not to.” Threads span everything from chine-runner performance to junk-rig versus sloop arguments—useful, opinionated, and documented well enough for latecomers to follow.

Platforms changed, but the community didn’t fade with them. When Yahoo Groups wound down, members hustled to preserve the archive and re-form on Groups.io. The new paradoxsailboat group exists explicitly to “exchange information” on building, owning, and sailing; the visible activity log shows ongoing posts into 2025. Even Alastair Law’s site links newcomers to the Groups.io list—and to Facebook. 

### Taking the conversation to Facebook

Most day-to-day conversation now happens on Facebook. The public Paradox Sailboat group shows 2,362 members and an active stream of build threads, gear questions, and sail reports; related communities like Duckworks Boat Builders and Really Simple Sails frequently host Paradox posts and videos. That mix of a broad social feed plus a searchable Groups.io list is where the living knowledge sits today. 

Underneath the names and URLs, a few habits define the Paradox crowd. People trade costs and time without pretense; they post photos and sketches when words get fuzzy; and when a boat launches, they show up—online or on the ramp—to cheer and to ask the next practical question. Between Elliott’s drawings, Maxwell’s images and notes, Law’s long-running site, and Martin’s blog, a new owner can still find what they need without starting from zero. That network is the real infrastructure of Paradox. 


## Modifications made to the Paradox

Since Matt Layden first drew Paradox, most builders have stayed close to the plans. The original design holds strong appeal: it is small, efficient, and self-sufficient. But over the years, a few projects have explored new directions, expanding the idea without losing its essential logic.

One early trailblazer was Ironsides, built by Stephen Yahn. He wanted a more open feel inside the cabin, and achieved this by removing the standard plywood shelving and replacing the full-height third bulkhead with a low, reinforced web. This steel-reinforced semi-bulkhead, encased in epoxy, preserved structural integrity while allowing the central area of the hull to remain clear from side to side. Rather than fixed lockers, Yahn considered using soft cloth bins—flexible storage that wouldn’t obstruct movement. While one still cannot stand or walk through a Paradox, this modification offered significantly more usable floor space and a greater sense of openness. A sketch labeled “Floorplan D” in the builder’s group files shows the layout he envisioned. Reports from his first outing mention steady helm behavior and a forgiving balance underway.

Another distinctive experiment was ParaPlastic, an all-composite Paradox built by Kjell Karlsson. In place of plywood, Karlsson used Divinycell foam core: 50 mm (2 inches) in the bottom for strength and insulation, 30 mm in the sides and deck, and 15 mm in the bulkheads. The foam was glassed inside with epoxy and skinned externally with polyester cloth in epoxy. He noted that the Divinycell provided such effective insulation that no interior lining was required—a practical advantage for cruising in colder waters. The boat was completed with familiar detailing and painted like any conventional hull. Years later, under a different owner, the boat is still actively sailed and reported to be in excellent condition, showing no sign of deterioration.

In Estonia, Eerik Mee scaled the concept up by about 20 percent and rigged his version as a junk. Drawing on discussions in the Junk Rig Association forums, he moved the mast forward—just ahead of the forward bulkhead—to match the altered center of effort typical of junk rigs. The chine runners were also moved forward to match. Mee chose a vertical-leech junk sail to help keep the sail’s force balanced over the hull. Launch reports mention good handling and successful tacks, with additional tuning of the rig underway.

One of the most visible builders to explore variations on the Paradox has been Michael J. Beebe, a Texas-based sailor, Duckworks Magazine contributor, and veteran of the Texas 200. Beebe built two Paradoxes, the second of which became known as Topless. For this boat, he removed the standard enclosed cabin entirely, leaving the hull open from coaming to coaming, and added substantial raised coamings around the cockpit opening to keep spray and boarding seas out. The result was an open-deck Paradox with the same hull and rig proportions as the original, but with a sailing experience closer to an open dinghy. This arrangement gave more immediate access to the sail and water, reduced weight above the sheer, and likely improved ventilation in hot Texas conditions, while still retaining the shallow-draft, chine-runner performance of Layden’s design.

These few examples show how flexible the Paradox idea can be. While the original design remains as practical as ever, a thoughtful builder can bend the framework without breaking it—testing ideas, solving specific problems, and building boats that reflect their own needs and cruising styles. Each variation continues the core conversation about what a compact, capable cruising boat can be.

### We're gonna need a bigger boat

Paradox’s influence also reaches beyond direct derivatives. Chris Morejohn’s Hogfish boats are his own “modified sharpie” designs, but community threads link their shallow-draft, simple-systems outlook to the same spirit. The original Hogfish, just over 30 ft, carried a ketch plan with a shallow board; Hogfish Maximus grew to 38 ft and combined chine runners with a forward daggerboard and a sloop rig. Glen Maxwell, writing from an Atlantic passage on Hogfish Maximus, reported that the chine runners “work great even at this size,” with the daggerboard used only when clawing hard to windward.

Layden himself explored larger takes on the type. A “Larger Paradox” file lays out a straight 20 percent increase—LOA about 5.04 m (16 ft 6 in), beam about 1.48 m (4 ft 11 in)—as a way to gain volume and range while keeping the architecture intact. Group correspondence also mentions a 23-foot sketch discussed with Morejohn.


### The modern small boats

Enigma, Layden’s lighter micro-cruiser that followed Paradox, showed the same philosophy in a smaller, car-toppable package. Group posts put the empty weight around 80 kg (about 180 lb) and note Layden loading it on a compact-car roof using a rack system. Unlike Paradox’s plywood roof, Enigma used a fabric hood/dodger for shelter.

In 2007 Layden drew Enigma 460, and George Van Sickle built the prototype. The 4.6 m (15 ft 1 in) hull kept the narrow beam and shoal draft but adopted a fixed plywood cabin top. Frequently cited particulars from the group give LOA 4.6 m (15 ft 1 in), beam 1,160 mm (45.6 in), draft 186 mm (7⅜ in), empty weight about 120 kg (≈260 lb), minimum removable ballast around 50 kg (≈110 lb), and sail area near 8.86 m² (95 sq ft).
